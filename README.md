 # realitycheck
A sample app that reality checks some basic features on your installation of CircleCI:
1. Runs all known resource_class options
2. Runs a machine executor & remote docker 
3. Read/write workspaces
4. Tests that the org-global context is working (*NOTE:* needs a key called `CONTEXT_END_TO_END_TEST_VAR` to exist in the `org-global` context)
5. Tests that multi-contexts are working (*NOTE:* a secondary context called `individual-local` that includes key `MULTI_CONTEXT_END_TO_END_VAR`)
6. Tests writing artifacts

To test your installation, clone this code and add it to your CircleCI as a project.

If you have more ideas for things that should tested please submit a PR against the open source repository on GitHub where this project is maintained: <https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck>
